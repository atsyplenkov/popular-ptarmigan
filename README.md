# Codename
Because project titles change all the time with revisions, rewriting, and peer review, we used codename to generate an Ubuntu-style internal-to-us project name that wonâ€™t change.

```
library(codename)
codename_message()
#> code name generated by {codename} v.0.5.0. R version 4.2.3 (2023-03-15 ucrt).

codename(seed = "sediment budget of a small basin", type = "ubuntu")
#> [1] "popular ptarmigan"
```
