# Codename
Because project titles change all the time with revisions, rewriting, and peer review, we used codename to generate an Ubuntu-style internal-to-us project name that wonâ€™t change.

``` r
library(codename)
codename_message()
#> code name generated by {codename} v.0.5.0. R version 4.2.3 (2023-03-15 ucrt).

codename(seed = "sediment budget of a small basin", type = "ubuntu")
#> [1] "popular ptarmigan"
```

# How to reproduce

1. Make sure that R `4.4.3` and `{renv}` packages are installed
2. Clone the repository and navigate to its directory in R
3. Run `renv::restore()` to install all required packages
4. The folder `workflow` contains all necessary steps to reproduce the results. Follow inner folders in order they are named to produce the results. Folder `src` contains additional functions that were written to support the analysis.
